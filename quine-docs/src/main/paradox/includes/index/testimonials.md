    "Quine represents a paradigm shift in online graph processing capabilities. By allowing data to react to itself as well as its relationships in real time, it gives you the capability to augment your graph on the fly and free up downstream consumers to react to changes without having to keep asking the same questions. This allows building more performant services with fewer resources."

    "Quine is a powerful new tool for anyone building event-driven applications. Standing queries let us match complex patterns as data arrives as well as query the past shape of data without the restriction of time windows."
