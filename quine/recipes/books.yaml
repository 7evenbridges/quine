summary: Demonstration of building a graph of reviewers, their reviews and products
description: |-
  Raw review data is imported from an example data set.
  For each review we create nodes for the review, the reviewer (user) and the
  reviewed product.

  Input review fields:
  ------------------
  reviewerID - ID of the reviewer, e.g. A2SUAM1J3GNN3B
  asin - ID of the product, e.g. 0000013714
  reviewerName - name of the reviewer
  vote - helpful votes of the review
  style - a dictionary of the product metadata, e.g., "Format" is "Hardcover"
  reviewText - text of the review
  overall - rating of the product
  summary - summary of the review
  unixReviewTime - time of the review (unix time)
  reviewTime - time of the review (raw)
  image - images that users post after they have received the product
